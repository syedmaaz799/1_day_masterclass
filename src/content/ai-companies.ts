/**
 * "The Companies Building the AI Future" (Section 5.5) — a cinematic, scroll-driven
 * roll call where each company is INTRODUCED as a brand reveal, not explained as a card.
 *
 * Order IS the narrative order. Each entry carries its own identity (brand `color`),
 * `personality` (so no two chapters feel the same), an editorial `essence`, the
 * `capabilities` that unfold, a `connection` that ties the company back to the
 * masterclass ("why this matters to me"), and a `bridge` line that hands off from the
 * previous company (the relay). `reveal` selects the brand-reveal motion.
 *
 * `color` is each company's official brand hue (used for the monumental logotype, the
 * background Core tint, accents and the progress rail). Where an exact official MARK is
 * reliably reproducible (OpenAI, Google, Microsoft) it is rendered in BrandLogos; every
 * other company is introduced by its official brand-color logotype (its name set in its
 * own colour) — real brand identity, never a generic icon. A real SVG mark can be added
 * to BrandLogos later without touching this data.
